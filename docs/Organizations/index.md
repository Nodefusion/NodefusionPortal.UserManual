# Organizations

## Organizations Select Page

This page has three parts (tabs):

1. A table of available organizations
2. A request form to access an organization
3. Activate a token that gives the user access to an organization

### A Table of available organizations

At the top of the page, you will see a table that reflects the permissions you have for the given organizations, if any.
The table lists the organizations you have access to. It has only one column, Organization Name. The values in the table are links to other pages of the application showing only information related to the organization you chose in the table.

### Organization Request Access

The second tab of the page shows a form with two text fields. One for Organization Name and another for VAT ID. When the user sends the form, he would receive an email containing a link with the access token needed for accessing his organization in the application.

### Activate Access

Activate Access (token) is the third part of the page. It contains a form with one text area field that expects an access token the user received from the email when requesting access to an organization. After activation of the given token, a user will need to log out and log in again so that the Organization will be shown in the organization list at the top of the page.
