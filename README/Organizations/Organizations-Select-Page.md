This page has three functionalities:
1. Choosing a to navigate to an existing organization that the user is a member of
2. Request access to an organization
3. Activate a token that gives the user access to an organization

A table of available organizations will be shown on the page and the user will use the link to the organization he would like access to.

The organization request needs the organization name and VAT ID to send the request.

The activation token is needed if a user wants to use the application, as they do not have any organization on first access.
