## Create Case

Case Create is a large form in which users fill in the information regarding the Case.

The form has two parts.

### General fields

This part is the same for all users who are creating a new case.
It consists of 6 fields that need to be filled:
 - Work service which enables some specific categories if your organization has them
 - Severity, and it describes the level of the case.
There are three levels of issues. The highest critical, next is urgent and the third level is important.
 - Email or emails of contacts that will communicate the issue with Nodefusion support. User should use the semicolon ( ; ) to separate multiple emails.
 - Contact phone number that Nodefusion Support will use.
 - Preferred way of communication with Nodefusion Support. Available options are email or phone.
 - Consent for the calls regarding the case to be recorded. 

### Category specific fields

The number of fields in the category part can change depending on the chosen category.

When you choose a category, the form will display additional fields that will help you better define your case.

The category field has at least four values to choose from: 
 - General
 - Create User Request
 - Deactivate User Request
 - User Credentials Reset Request

It can also contain some specific categories if your organization's work service has them assigned.

### Action buttons

On the top of the create Case we have two buttons. 

The Save button is disabled until the user fills in the values in all the required fields. When you press save, a new case will be created based on the values you set inside the fields.

The TeamViewer button will download a TeamViewer QuickSupport app that will allow a Nodefusion Support agent to connect to the user's computer and help regarding the case.
