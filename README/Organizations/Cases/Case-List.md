## Case List

The page shows a table of active cases.
The table has several columns: Case Title, Case Number, Contact, Created On, Severity, Support Level and Status.

Above the table are two buttons, Create new case and TeamViewer.
Create new case button opens a new page where the user can create a new case.

The TeamViewer button will download a TeamViewer QuickSupport app that will allow a Nodefusion Support agent to connect to the user's computer and help regarding the case.
