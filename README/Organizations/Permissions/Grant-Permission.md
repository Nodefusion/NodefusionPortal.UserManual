## Grant Permission


The Grant Permission page allows a user to request additional permission for himself or another user inside the organization.
The request form consists of three fields:
  - Permission (field options values are: SupportUser, Read, Write, Manage and FullAccess)
  - Expires on (read-only field, set to current date + 3 days)
  - Invitation Email (user who will receive permission)

The button Grant Permission is disabled until the user fills in all fields. The user will receive an email with the activation token needed on the Organization Select page.

:warning:**_NOTE:_**  
_Keep in mind that the Invitation email field must be the one which user is (or will be) registered on Nodefusion Portal with. Upon permission activation, it will be checked if the token is generated for the correct user._
