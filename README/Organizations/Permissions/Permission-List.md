## Permission List


The Permission List page contains a table of user Permissions.
It has three columns.

The first column is a checkbox; a user can select one or more rows in a table.

The second column is Display Name, showing the user's full name.

The third column shows the permission that the user has.

Above the table there are two buttons.
The Grant Permission button redirects the user to the Grant Permission page.
The delete button deletes the selected permissions in table.
