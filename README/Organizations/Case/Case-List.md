## Case List

The page shows a table of active cases.
The table has several columns: Case Title, Case Number, Contact, Created On, Severity, Support Level and Status.

Above the table are two buttons, Create new case and TeamViewer.
Create new case button opens a new page where the user can create a new case.

The TeamViewer button downloads a TeamViewer link where the Nodefusion Support Agent can access the user's computer and directly see the problem that the case would describe.
