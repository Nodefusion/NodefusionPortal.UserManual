## Permissions

Users can see information regarding organization permissions and event request permissions for users.

## Permission List

The Permissions table shows organization permission and the users those permissions are assigned to.
The table columns are:
  - Checkbox (used for selecting one or more rows)
  - Display Name
  - Permission

The Grant Permission button redirects the user to the Grant Permission page.
The Delete button deletes the selected permissions in table. 

:warning:**_NOTE:_**  
Keep in mind that Delete permission action requires the affected users to refresh the access token (or make log out - log in).
