## Terms

Before the application can be used the user needs to accept the terms and conditions.
If the user has not accepted the terms in the application before he would be redirected to the Terms page.

The terms page contains a simple form. The form contains a link to terms and condition of the application and a checkbox where you need to accept the terms to be allowed access to the application.
